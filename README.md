## Running the Application

### Creating a virtual environment for your Python project and running a streamlit app involves the following steps:

#### Install virtualenv:

If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it using pip:

Create a new virtual environment:

Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
Create a new virtual environment using the following command:

```python -m venv venv```

This will create a new directory called "venv" in your project folder, containing a clean Python environment.
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

On macOS and Linux:

```source venv/bin/activate```

After running this command, you should see the name of your virtual environment in the terminal prompt.
Install necessary packages:

Once the virtual environment is activated, use pip to install the required packages for your project, including streamlit:

```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can also install any other required packages using pip.

Run the streamlit app:

```streamlit run app.py```
This will start a local server and open your streamlit app in a web browser.

By following these steps, you can create a virtual environment, install the necessary packages, and run your streamlit app locally for development and testing.
